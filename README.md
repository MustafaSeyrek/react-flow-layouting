# React Flow Layouting

With this project, only selected nodes on the screen in the [React Flow](https://reactflow.dev/) library can be aligned horizontally and vertically. The selection process can be done one by one with ctrl or multiples with Shift + drag. Afterwards, alignment can be done with the V (vertical) and H (horizontal) buttons in the Controls section.
